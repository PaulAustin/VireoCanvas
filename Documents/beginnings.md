### Beginnings
Initialy looked a cairo since I've tracked it for a few years, but never have gottern around to using it.
Raj Milan also pointed out Skia, and Moz2d. This documents covers notes on those comparisons.

* Cairo

* Skia

* Moz2d (aka GFX, Azure)


### Notes on building Skia:
Im coming from OSX, so there are good docs on Google's site though the topic is still quite sparse, and some are quite old (XCode 3)

Once GYP was properly installed The SampleApp built fine, an ran.
